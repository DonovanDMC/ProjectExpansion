# Project Expansion
An unofficial expansion of [ProjectE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projecte).
## This mod is not officially supported or endorsed by ProjectE
Do not contact them for support. If you want
support, [open an issue](https://github.com/DonovanDMC/ProjectExpansion/issues/new) on the github, or ask about it in
the `#bug-report` channel or our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SwxbbmMKQH) - make sure to mention what version of
the mod you're using!

This is based on [ProjectEX](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projectex-forge), which seems to be mostly
abandoned at this point. This has been rewritten from the ground up, and has some new things.

Used for crafting, also has accompanying blocks. Several of these hit the integer limit for burn times, which is

### Final Star
The shard is a crafting ingredient, the Final Star does not have any uses currently but bragging about the 648.79 Quadrillion (648,793,397,761,517,310) it takes to get one.

### EMC Values
Due to the huge emc values that are present here, we shorten any emc values over one million. You can hold shift to show the real value.
