# Project Expansion
An unofficial expansion of [ProjectE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projecte).
## This mod is not officially supported or endorsed by ProjectE
Do not contact them for support. If you want support, comment on the [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/project-expansion), or [open an issue](https://github.com/DonovanDMC/ProjectExpansion/issues/new) - make sure to mention what version of the mod you're using!

This is based on [ProjectEX](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projectex-forge), which seems to be mostly abandoned at this point. This has been rewritten from the ground up, and has some new things.

## Features

### EMC Display
Your current emc and overall gain/loss will be displayed in the top left corner.

### Matter
We've got quite a bit of our own matter. These are used in crafting recipes.

### Fuel
Used for crafting, also has accompanying blocks. Several of these hit the integer limit for burn times, which is somewhere around 40 months total. (these values might be changed in the future)

### Final Star
The shard is a crafting ingredient, the Final Star does not have any uses currently but bragging about the 648.79 Quadrillion (648,793,397,761,517,310) it takes to get one.

### Arcane Table/Tablet
These do nothing special yet, they're just about the same as ProjectE's versions.

### EMC Values
Due to the huge emc values that are present here, we shorten any emc values over one million. You can hold shift to show the real value.
